description: 'The Pillars of Society (original Norwegian title: Samfundets st√∏tter)
  is an 1877 play written by Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. Ibsen had great trouble
  with the writing of this play which came before the series of masterpieces which
  made him famous throughout the world. The ending is the most criticised feature,
  since Bernick is clearly guilty of attempted murder but gets off unscathed, but
  successfully illustrates that the rich and powerful are often selfish and corrupt.--
